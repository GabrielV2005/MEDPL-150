<p>Homework four required us to make two photomontages. I wanted my photomontage to draw inspiration from video games and fantasy worlds. My first photomontage depicts a knight from the popular video game Dark Souls 3, kneeling amid burning flames with an eclipse looming in the background. The knight is called the Soul of Cinder and is the final boss fight of Dark Souls 3. During the boss fight, the Soul of Cinder can manipulate fire to attack the player, and there is also an eclipse in the background. I wanted to recreate the same scene in my first photomontage. So I went on the internet looking for the proper images to use for my photomontage. After putting them on Photoshop, I made them into layers and started removing the background of the flame and knight images.

<p>My second photomontage takes inspiration from a fantasy setting. After creating my first photomontage, the idea for my second one just appeared in my head. I'm not sure why I wanted to make it, but I did. The second photomontage depicts a pirate ship in space about to be attacked by a dragon. I liked the juxtaposition of a pirate ship in space. Pirate ships are mainly tied to history and the ocean, and whenever we see space in any media, it is always depicted as futuristic. Once I had all my images, like the first photomontage, I made them into layers and started removing the background on the dragon and the pirate ship. Removing the background of the pirate ship was tricky since not everything got removed, so I had to use the paintbrush tool to do it manually.
