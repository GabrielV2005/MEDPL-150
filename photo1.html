<h1>Reflection</h1>

<img src="image1.jpg" alt="My first photo" width="600">  
<p>When I first heard the instructions for homework two, I already had an idea of where I wanted to take my first photo. The skybridges in the west building have great views, and I believe this photo resonates with New Yorkers because it's a view they have seen multiple times. When I put my photo into Photoshop and cropped the image to 1920 x 1080 pixels, the rectangular format directed greater visual focus to the center of the picture, highlighting the presence of the cars. The original photo was brighter than this one, but after doing tonal adjustments, I made the photo look gloomy, like it was a cloudy day. I played around with the RGB colors until I settled on something I liked. I chose this photo not only because I thought it would resonate with New Yorkers but also because, like many other people, I enjoy gloomy and cloudy days. It may sound odd, but for some reason, gloomy and cloudy make my bed a lot more comfortable than sunny days. Ultimately, I selected this photo because I believe it captures the essence of New York City by making a change to the RGB colors. I managed to make the photo darker.
