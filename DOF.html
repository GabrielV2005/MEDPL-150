<p>Part one of homework three required us to take two photographs with the same composition and exposure. One photo with a shallow depth of field and another with a deep depth of field. At first, I had to decide what I wanted to take a photo of. I chose to take a photograph of my water bottle standing with a window behind it. I decided to take the first photo with a deep depth of field. I adjusted the aperture and the ISO to make sure everything is in focus and that the photo is bright enough. The second photo was a shallow depth of field. I lowered the aperture to get a photo with a shallow depth of field, although I kept the ISO the same. Part one also required editing a photo to get a shallow depth of field. So I put the deep depth of field photo in Photoshop and artificially made the background blurry. I made the background blurry by using the field blur feature in Photoshop. I selected certain points on the image and adjusted the blur to make certain parts of the image blurry. Part two of the homework had us use the Camera Raw filter in Photoshop to adjust the exposure. I took another photograph for the second part of the homework. The photograph was a picture looking out the same window that was behind my water bottle, looking at a pigeon standing on an air conditioner. I put the photo in Photoshop twice, adjusting the exposure two different times, getting different results.
