<p>Homework five required us to work on our photomontages from homework four. We were instructed to use Illustrator to create a design with one or more repeating shapes with one color that will be incorporated into our photomontages. Homework four wanted us to brainstorm a political, social, or ecological issue that interests us and use that issue to inform our designs. With homework five, I wanted to make clear what issue influences my photomontages. For the first photomontage, the ecological issue that I used is light pollution. I wanted to use light pollution because in my twenty years of living in New York City, I have never seen stars in the night sky. For the design of the first photomontage, I created multiple different stars with varying colors, and I put the words “Too much light dims our world”. The fire is supposed to represent light pollution, and the knight has slight burns around his body, showing that he has been exposed to too much light. For my second photomontage, it is a bit difficult to figure out the message. This one is supposed to represent humanity's constant need to conquer new realms. The ship is supposed to represent conquerors like Columbus, and how that same ambition is being carried into space. The dragon attacking the ship represents nature pushing back against that ambition. This photomontage says that humanity's need to conquer new land can destroy it. For the design of this one, I took inspiration from the NASA logo. I made a crack in the middle, and the quote for this one is “ our reach burns brighter than our wisdom”.
