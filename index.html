<p>Homework 1 involves creating an index page on GitHub. It was my first experience with web development. I learned several things about HTML. I learned about how to use tags and headers, and how to structure code in HTML. I was a bit overwhelmed when the professor first explained the task. I believed that I had to do the code ourselves, but it was a simple as copying and pasting the code that was on the MEDPL 150 website. An index page on a website is the default page a web server displays. I saw this task as my first step in web development. I’ve been interested in web development for a while now, and I was excited when I learned about the coding homework in this class. I did run into some difficulties when doing this task. After copying and pasting the code, I was confused about how to edit my code once I submitted it. On the MEDPL 150 website, the instructions state that after pasting the code, we should submit it, but the instructions never say how to go back to editing. The assignment also made me think about how I wanted to present my websites to others. It made me think critically about what I wanted to show. Ultimately, the assignment reminded me that media studies isn’t only about learning how media affects but also about creating it.
