<h1>Reflection</h1>

<img src="image2.jpg" alt="My second photo" width="600">  
<p>This photo is one that I didn’t plan to take, but when my partners pointed out the cute sleeping pigeon, I felt like I just needed to take a picture of it. Like the first photo, I think that this photo resonates with New Yorkers. Aside from the giant rats that exist in New York City, pigeons have to be one of the animals that New Yorkers see daily. Per the homework instruction, I needed to crop the second to 5 x 7 inches. When cropping the picture, I mainly wanted to focus on the pigeon's face to show that it was sleeping. When editing the photo, I decided to adjust the RGB colors to make the photo look purple.  Purple is one of my favorite colors, so I decided to make one of my photos purple. I chose purple not only because it's one of my favorite colors but also because purple is a color of royalty. Pigeons are basically the mascot of New York City, so knowing that, I thought purple would be a fitting color. Ultimately, although I didn’t plan on taking his photo, I am glad I took it. Pigeons are the mascots of New York City, and by editing the RGB colors, I settled on a color I liked.
