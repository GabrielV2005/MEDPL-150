<p>For homework 8, we were assigned to make two GIFs.The first GIF is to make the eye from homework 6 blink, and in the second, we take or find a photograph and make the person in the photo move. For the blinking eye, I had to copy my design from Illustrator and put it into Photoshop. Before I pasted it, I had to create different eyelids so when I put it into Photoshop, it would look like the eye is blinking. Once it was pasted into Photoshop, I had to resize it to the correct size. I also had to make sure every eyelid was in its own layer. After that, I could put the layers into the timeline to make the eye blink. For the second GIF, I found an image of a man running. I had to use the puppet warp tool to make different versions of the man in various positions. I selected the man's elbow, knees, shoulders,  legs, and arms, and manipulated them to create different positions. I then put the different versions into layers and then put them in the timeline. This allowed me to create the illusion of the man running. This homework was definitely the most difficult so far. I was having several problems pasting my eye into Photoshop. When I tried to resize my eye, the stroke changed when the eye was made smaller. It made the stroke thicker and the look different from homework 6.
