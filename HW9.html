<p>For homework 9, we were required to gather data and make a graph in Illustrator. I wanted to gather data on people's favorite entertainment media. So I made a Google form and shared it with family and friends. The form asked the question “What is your favorite form of entertainment?” and there were 5 options which were television, films, video games, books, and social media content. After getting all my responses, I put the data on a Google Sheet so I can paste it into Illustrator. On Illustrator, I selected the graph tool and chose the circle graph option. I then pasted the data from the Google sheet into the editing table for the graph. I received ten responses from my Google form, 40% chose social media content, 30% chose video games, 20% chose films, and 10% chose television. Using that data, I was able to create a circle graph that looked identical to the one the Google Form produced. In order to change the color of each slice, I had to ungroup the whole graph and select the slice I wanted to change. I then changed each slice to different colors to make it clear what each slice is. On the right, I also created four squares with the color of each slice, then next to the squares, I put the options that each person chose, so people know what each slice represents.
