<p>Homework six was a bit different from the others I’ve done because it's one we did in class. It felt more like a class assignment than actual homework. The only thing I did at home was some finishing edits. Homework six required us to use Illustrator to create an eye with two shapes, two complementary colors, and two line styles expressing fear, surprise, sadness, or anger. We could create our eyes in any style we like, so I chose an anime style. I chose the style of anime mainly because I am a huge anime fan. I’ve been watching anime ever since I was eight years old. This is something I do to this day, but mainly when I was in middle school and high school, I used to draw a lot of anime styles in class. When I was distracted or bored in class, I would doodle in my notebook, and anime eyes were one of the main things I drew. The main emotion I wanted to convey with my eye is happiness. In anime, it is a common trope that when a character is really happy or excited, they get stars in their eyes. When choosing the complementary colors, I wanted to have two that would stand out a lot. So I went to Adobe colors and settled on green and red. So I chose green for the sclera and red for the iris. For the iris, I chose a blue to complement the iris.
