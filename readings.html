<h1>Reading Reflections</h1>

<h2>Susan Sontag Reflection</h2>
<p>. The two approaches to photography that I mainly align myself with are street photography and wildlife photography. I like the approach of street photography because I can capture everyday moments in public spaces. If you want to show a non-New Yorker what life in New York City is like, street photography is the perfect way to do it. You can take photos of the crowds of people in the morning, walking to work, taking public transportation, or even various huge buildings around New York City. In Susan Sontag’s “In Plato’s Cave,” she states, “ To photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed. It means putting oneself into a certain relation to the world that feels like knowledge…” Sontag states that collecting photographs is to  “collect the world.” I believe that is what street photography does, showing people around the world, places with different people and cultures than their own. Wildlife photography is another approach that has always interested me. I like capturing animals in their natural habitat. Wildlife photography can be a great way to learn how animals behave in their natural environment. My second photo could be considered an example of wildlife photography. It's a photo of a pigeon sleeping on a building ledge. Since the pigeon is part of the Urban environment, photographing it while it is sleeping on a ledge should count as wildlife photography. When I make images, I  first decide what I want to photograph. Then I chose the angle for my photo. For my first photo, I picked an angle that would allow me to see most of the street. For photo two, I picked an angle that would let me see the face of the pigeon. I emphasized the pigeon's face because I wanted to show that it was sleeping. Sontag states that “ Photographs really are experience capture, and the camera is the ideal arm of consciousness in its acquisitive mood.” Sontag states that a photograph doesn’t just show an object; it captures a moment of a lived experience. She is saying that when are mind is in the mood to collect experiences, a camera is a perfect tool to do so. This is something that I thought about when taking my photographs, because it is true that the camera is the perfect tool to capture experiences. Now, when it comes to editing my images, I make sure to crop them properly. In photo one, although I picked an angle that would allow me to see most of the street, I wanted to make sure that the center of the image was the main focus. So I cropped the image appropriately to make sure of that. In image two, I cropped the image to focus on the pigeon's upper body. That way, the pigeon's sleeping face is more visible to the viewer. Ultimately, I agree with Sontag that photography can be used to capture experiences. Through street and wildlife photography, I show how I perceive the world around me.

<h2>Nesrine Malik Reflection</h2>
<p>Nesrine Malik's article about AI in content creation shows us how AI can negatively impact our society. Malik defines AI slop as “ low-quality content with minimal human input.” She states the content is widespread and infiltrates social media timelines and private messaging apps. I agree that AI content definitely has low amounts of effort in it, and it can fool people that actually real content. Malik states that AI has become a tool for propaganda, allowing for the creation of infinite fictitious scenarios with the constraint of real life. Malik brings up the example of AI-generated YouTube videos of political victories. “There are entire YouTube videos of made-up scenarios in which Trump officials prevail against liberal forces. The White House account on X jumped on a trend of creating images in Studio Ghibli style and posted an image of a Dominican woman in tears as she is arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice)”. Malik states that the AI is trained on pre-existing, biased data, which reinforces norms against ethnic diversity and progressive gender rolles. This has led AI to become the “new aesthetic of fascism”. Although I do agree that AI can be used in content creation to do harmful things, I don’t think it's all bad when used properly. AI can be used to lighten the workload of content creators, making it easier and faster to create content. Malik states that constant exposure to AI images leads people to not know what is real and fake, making it difficult to trust what they see. I do see where she is coming from. It may be hard for people to trust online news because when they are constantly exposed to AI images, they have a hard time knowing if what they are seeing is real. In my experience, I have seen things on TikTok that I have hard to believing because I’ve seen a lot of AI content on the app. Malik states how much of the AI slop follows a pattern of “content farming chaos”; the material is often exaggerated because this boosts engagement. So social media giants like Facebook or Instagram view this as “highly engaging content”. When I first read this, I was surprised that social media companies see AI content as a way to boost engagement. Ultimately, Nesrine Malik's article talks about how, when AI is integrated into content creation, it can negatively impact society. She talks about how AI is trained on biased information and how constant exposure to AI can make it hard for people to distinguish what is real or fake.

<h2>Motherhood in Crisis</h2>
<p>For this reflection, the story I used is “My Stolen Future”. The story revolves around a girl named Heela and how she was raped. Heela ends up getting pregnant and tells her grandmother about what happened to her. She was sent to the Rainbo centre by the police, where she received counselling to help her deal with the trauma. The graphic novel uses a combination of illustrations, photos, and videos to tell the story. I believe illustrations were used to help the reader understand what is happening in the story better. If the story were told only in the photographs or videos, we would not be able to see the events of how Heela’s mother died of Ebola, how her father married again, and was sent to live with her grandmother, and how she ended up being raped. The illustrations are important because they can show us things that videos and photographs cannot, and without the illustrations, we are forced to use our imaginations to show us all the previous events stated. The graphic novel's use of photography was unexpected to me; the photographs are of Neneh Conteh, a counselor at the Rainbo centre. The first photo is of Neneh Conteh consoling Heela, and the second one is Neneh Conteh comforting Heela. I believe photographs were used to give the reader a better understanding of the counseling that happens in the Rainbo centre. If illustrations were used for the counseling part, readers who may have experienced similar events and had counseling may have found it hard to relate to Heela. The Illustrations vary from the photographs by showing us the emotions on the characters. We get to see and read how they feel and unless you have actors who can perfectly replicate the emotions shown in the illustrations, photographs are inferior to the illustrations.

<h2>The Rising Risk, and How We Stop It</h2>
<p>The article  “The Rising Risk, and How We Stop it” by W.J. Hennigan is about the dramatically elevated risk of nuclear conflict. The article also touches upon the U.S. and Ukraine's planning efforts and the breakdown of arms control agreements. The text states that the possibility of a nuclear strike is more likely now than at any other time since the Cold War.  Hennigan states how today’s nuclear weapons are often smaller than the size of the bombs used on Japan in 1945, but that they are deadlier. The nuclear threat hangs over current battlefields like Ukraine, as well as other areas like the Persian Gulf, Taiwan Strait, and the Korean Peninsula. Few believe that Putin will use city-destroying hydrogen bombs, but people in the West think that Russia will use tactical nuclear weapons. These weapons are less destructive and designed to strike targets over short distances; they are considered more usable in war. The use of any tactical nuclear weapon would be an unprecedented test of dogma of deterrence. Deterrence, which has underwritten America’s military policy for 70 years, relies on the balance of terror, ensuring the enemy fears an overwhelming counterattack. The U.S. and Ukraine have been planning for nuclear conflict for two years, recognizing that nuclear war is not “talked about enough”. Four days after Russia invaded Ukraine, the Biden administration directed a small group of experts and strategists called the “Tiger Team,” who were tasked with coming up with a nuclear “playbook” of contingency plans and responses to a nuclear attack. The playbook contains a detailed menu of diplomatic and military options for President Biden and future presidents. Ukraine has set hundreds of radiation detectors and identified 200 hospitals as go-to facilities, training hundreds of medical workers, and stockpilling millions of potassium iodide tablets. U.S. intelligence estimated that in Ukrainian forces managed to break through Russian defenses and march towards the occupied Crimean Peninsula, the chances of Russia using a tactical nuclear weapon to stop them were 50-50.
