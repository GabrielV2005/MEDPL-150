<h2>Susan Sontag Reflection</h2>
<p>. The two approaches to photography that I mainly align myself with are street photography and wildlife photography. I like the approach of street photography because I can capture everyday moments in public spaces. If you want to show a non-New Yorker what life in New York City is like, street photography is the perfect way to do it. You can take photos of the crowds of people in the morning, walking to work, taking public transportation, or even various huge buildings around New York City. In Susan Sontag’s “In Plato’s Cave,” she states, “ To photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed. It means putting oneself into a certain relation to the world that feels like knowledge…” Sontag states that collecting photographs is to  “collect the world.” I believe that is what street photography does, showing people around the world, places with different people and cultures than their own. Wildlife photography is another approach that has always interested me. I like capturing animals in their natural habitat. Wildlife photography can be a great way to learn how animals behave in their natural environment. My second photo could be considered an example of wildlife photography. It's a photo of a pigeon sleeping on a building ledge. Since the pigeon is part of the Urban environment, photographing it while it is sleeping on a ledge should count as wildlife photography. When I make images, I  first decide what I want to photograph. Then I chose the angle for my photo. For my first photo, I picked an angle that would allow me to see most of the street. For photo two, I picked an angle that would let me see the face of the pigeon. I emphasized the pigeon's face because I wanted to show that it was sleeping. Sontag states that “ Photographs really are experience capture, and the camera is the ideal arm of consciousness in its acquisitive mood.” Sontag states that a photograph doesn’t just show an object; it captures a moment of a lived experience. She is saying that when are mind is in the mood to collect experiences, a camera is a perfect tool to do so. This is something that I thought about when taking my photographs, because it is true that the camera is the perfect tool to capture experiences. Now, when it comes to editing my images, I make sure to crop them properly. In photo one, although I picked an angle that would allow me to see most of the street, I wanted to make sure that the center of the image was the main focus. So I cropped the image appropriately to make sure of that. In image two, I cropped the image to focus on the pigeon's upper body. That way, the pigeon's sleeping face is more visible to the viewer. Ultimately, I agree with Sontag that photography can be used to capture experiences. Through street and wildlife photography, I show how I perceive the world around me.
